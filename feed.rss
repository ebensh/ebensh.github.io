        Ep 46: Dr. Azra Raza on Mouse Model Misconceptions &amp; Other Ways We Can Improve Cancer Research
      </title>
      <link/>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[
        When we think of conducting science experiments on subjects, we immediately think of mice models. But today&#039;s guest, Dr. Azra Raza, who appeared on Adam Ruins Science, says there&#039;s a more effective way. On the TV show Dr. Raza discussed how the mouse model scientists use for their research is actually ineffective; even though a medicine might work well on a rodent, the results don&#039;t translate as well as we thought to humans - especially when it comes to cancer research which is what Dr. Raza studies. Even though humans and mice share over 90 percent of their DNA with one another, our bodies still differ in numerous ways; we metabolize food and medicine differently and humans are significantly bigger than mice in size. This wastes money from the limited amount of funding that already exists and encourages clinical trials that ultimately go nowhere. On the podcast, Dr. Raza proposes a different research method that she has used herself, to much success.
       
        Dr. Raza is a Professor of Medicine and Director of the MDS Center at Columbia University in New York. Previously she conducted her research at Rush University, Chicago, Illinois in 1992, where she was the Charles Arthur Weaver Professor in Oncology and Director, Division of Myeloid Diseases.

<title>Ezra Klein - Work as identity, burnout as lifestyle</title>
<description>
In the past few months, two essays on America’s changing relationship to work caught my eye. The first was <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work">Anne Helen Petersen’s viral BuzzFeed piece</a> defining, and describing, “millennial burnout.” The second was <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/religion-workism-making-americans-miserable/583441/">Derek Thompson’s Atlantic article on “workism.”</a><br><br>The two pieces speak to each other in interesting ways, and to some questions I’ve been reflecting on as my own relationship to work changes. So I asked the authors to join me for a conversation about what happens when work becomes an identity, capitalism becomes a religion, and productivity becomes the way we measure human value. The conversation exceeded even the high hopes I had for it. Enjoy this one.<br><br><strong>Book recommendations:<br></strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kids-These-Days-Capital-Millennials/dp/0316510866"><em>Kids These Days: Human Capital and the Making of Millennials</em></a><em> </em>by Malcolm Harris<br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/White-Essays-Culture-Richard-Dyer/dp/0415095379"><em>White: Essays on Race and Culture</em></a><em> </em>by Richard Dyer<br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vertigo-Years-Europe-1900-1914/dp/0465020291"><em>The Vertigo Years: Europe, 1900-1914</em></a><em> </em>by Philipp Blom<br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visit-Goon-Squad-Jennifer-Egan/dp/0307477479"><em>A Visit from the Goon Squad</em></a><em> </em>by Jennifer Egan<br><br>If you’ll be in Washington, DC, on Thursday, April 25, join us for a morning of live podcasts in celebration of our fifth birthday.
